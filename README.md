# DHS110 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry

### Patrick Khoury | Digital Humanities 110 | Fall 2022 | Dr. Sookie Cho 


## ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?  
* This project will promote efficiency for user sustainability efforts through the consolidation of a a variety of environmental sustainability services, such as carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furnature repurposing, sustainability events, etc into one app presented as a social-media platform. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
* This activity fulfills a myriad of the user’s [psychological needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Transcendence_needs), which according to the creator of this philosophy, Maslow, drives behavioral motivation.
* The first need this activity fufills is the foundation of the hierarchy, physiological needs. This is made up of the biological components for human survival. Clothing falls into this category, which is one service which will be consolidated in my design. Thrifting/clothing swaps offer a cheap and accessible way to get clothes, while being the best option in terms of sustainability. It keeps clothes out of landfills, reduces carbon and chemical pollution caused by clothing production, and lowers water consumption.
* The second need this activity fufills is the need for belonging and love. This need is made up belonging and acceptance among social groups. The design I want to employ is a platform primarily presented as social-media network which consolidates sustainability services. Users would have a profile page and the option to follow their friends and others. Allowing location while the app is in use may allow for the details of relevant environmental activities in the user's area to be shown, encouraging the target users to go our and participate with existing friends or make new ones. This inherently creates social groups for the users to belong to and in turn fufills this sense of belonging and love. 
* The third need this activity fufills is esteem need. This need is broken up into two facets: low and high esteem. Low esteem is made up of respect from others and may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention.  High esteem is made up of the need for self-respect, and can include a need for strength, competence, mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom. My design fufills both high and low esteem in users whom choses to participate. Low esteem is fufilled through the social media aspect, where users may post themselves at sustainability events which may result in recognition from peers. High esteem may be fufilled as reserarch suggests that doing good deeds (i.e. participating in sustainability practices) results in the release of endorphins and tend to lead to feelings of self-confidence and self-respect.
* The fourth need this activity fufills is the cognitive need. This is made up of creativity, foresight, curiosity, and meaning. As previously stated, partaking in good deeds leads to a sense of meaning, fufilling this cognitive need.
* The fifth need this activity fufills is the aesthetic need. This need is made up of having the ability to appreciate the beauty within the world around one's self, on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of sustainability practices is to conserve natural resources and protect global ecosystems to support health and wellbeing. This involves the conservation of ecosystems, air quality, integreity, and supporting health and wellbeing. 
* The sixth and final need this activity fufills is the self-actualization need. This is made up of desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be. As previously mentioned, reserarch suggests that doing good deeds (i.e. participating in sustainability practices) results in the release of endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin. Participating in sustainability practies is an accomplishment in itself, and can help users fufill this self-actualization need.


#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
* The traditional solutions are all spread across different platforms. A myriad of options are available, but are difficult to utilize efficiently. Facebook marketplace exists for the purpose of helping individuals and businesses sell items locally. Clothing swap apps exist primarily in Europe for the purpose of to find new homes for the items you once treasured and give someone else's old treasures a new, happy home. The Green Globe program works with consumers, companies and communities to create a sustainable industry. Waze carpool offers services where they provide rides for people to carpool. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
* Limitations with the current solution include but are not limited to visibility, efficiency, barriers to entry different platforms, and more. Each platform comes with its existing issues. Facebook marketbplace requires users to create a facebook account and put in payment and shipping information. Clothing swap apps are prominant in Europe, but not the United States. There are not many Green Globe members due to the lengthy, difficult, and costly process. There are only 24 across the US, and they are not dispersed well, as most are concentrated in a few areas. Waze carpool does not allow the option for users to carpool using the cars they own. My design would improve upon these issues, while promoting sustainability head on, and address the detachment between services due to them being spread across different platforms. Furthermore, there is little education involved within this platforms, as the services themselves are sustainable, but users are not informed on the purposes behind these practices. My design will consolodate and improve on the aforementioned services while explicitly informing the consumer on proper sustainability practices.


## ✅ Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: students (college undergraduates, grad students), young adults aged 25-35 with professional careers
* Preferences: users participate in social activities/have some form of social media, users care about the environment in some capacity
* Expertise: users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project

#### Where would the users do that activity?
* Users can participate in the aformentioned sustainable services in the traditional method through their mobile phone or by use of the internet. Certain services may not be available in particular locations, however the internet makes the majority of the services extremely easy to access and utilize. Some kind of account creation or monetary exchange are usually necessary, and the services are typically separated by the corporations which run these services (i.e. Facebook account is needed for facebook marketplace, Waze account is needed for Waze Carpool, Depop account and credit information is needed for Depop, etc.)
* In my design, users can log into a singular community based application where all concerns would be addressed in the same place. All of the aforementioned services would be consolidated, and additional features allowing what they read anywhere at anytime, as long as they have their device. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
* The goal of the users would be to receive some service whether it be a clothing exchange, carpooling, refurnishing old furnature, etc. Users would typically log into the separate service providers and complete an action or pay for the certain service. These users, whether they know it or not, are participating in environmental sustainability practices. My design would consolidate these services, educate the user about the environmental purposes behind each service, provide social events, and incentivize the practices through presenting the platform as a social media platform. 


## ✅ Step 3: Pick Research Methods

#### Methods
* I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory observation and interview. 
  * For participatory observation, I observed 2 activities: logging a book by hand and finding a book to read in
  the Amazon Kindle store.
    * Logging a book by hand: I asked the user what a book log entry would look like, if she were to record the books she read.
    * Finding a book in the Kindle store: I asked the user how she would find a book she wants to read from the website, and 
    what she values when looking for a book to read.
* Both were conducted in the user’s own home, by their desk where they feel most comfortable. 
This would also be a place where they usually read books at home.
* I used an iPhone to voice record the interview and a laptop camera to record the user task.
* Because I could not find another in-person participant for these activity, unfortunately I had to ask the participant
from my usability test to complete these activities.

## ✅ Step 5: Conducting the Research

* Please find the transcription of the whole interview and participatory observation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntXiUR08Zort2SHEj1qfp0-OA8j3um7zz1YcoXGM_vE/edit?usp=sharing)
* Below are the recordings and videos of the interview and participatory observation.

  * [Participatory Observation: Book Log Entry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6Z54MJ6QVlY1PFlMVPBQbS5MiHW0VDS/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Participatory Observation: Kindle Store](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1deuHFWOM8IM9smYEeMUHy1REGij0QI8q/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Contextual Intervew: Other Questions & Closing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meUJAbnnbLskso-EQBxfQaAuH9I88YAC/view?usp=sharing)

* Some interesting insights from the interview:
  * *Book logging as a creative outlet*
  
    > "Handwriting it out, I feel like, would be a creative outlet, 
    like you can just lay it out however you’d like, use whatever pens you like, you know... I’d say it’s definitely 
    therapeutic, i’d want to change the style of it, maybe change the font if I don’t like it, just yeah. 
    I want it to be tailored to my kind of aesthetic or how I like it."
    
    To this user, book logging would not just be an information dump, but a place to de-stress and journal creatively about
    the book she read. It seems like she values the aesthetics and being able to tailor an entry to her own style.
    
  * *Not wanting to waste time when finding a book*
  
    > "I guess I don’t want to waste my time, so I really want to pick and choose something that I know that I would like."
    
    The user does not want to waste her time finding a book or reading a book she does not like, and thus would want a recommendation
    that is reliable.
   
  * *Sharing as a motivation for keeping track of books*
  
    > "[I'd want to include] rating, so I could recommend it to others."
    
    > *In response to "What would your motivation to record or keep track of the books be?":* 
    "So, maybe I could recommend it to other people as well, and share it with other people."
    
    Part of the motivation to keep track of books the user has read seems like being able to share books with other people,
    not just for personal records. Recording books is not just for the user's development or satisfaction, but also for 
    social connection.


## ✅ Step 6: Reflection

* The contextual inquiry process felt a lot more fluid and natural than usability testing, most likely because this was more
about *what, why,* and *how* a user does an activity and less about a particular product. Asking and observing the user gave
me a lot of interesting insight. For example, I did not expect the user to want to log a book as a creative outlet. It was also
interesting to find out that part of the motivation for recording books was to recommend them to other people. Unfortunately, I
had to use the same participant as my usability test (due to stay-at-home orders because of COVID-19), but I was still able
to find a lot of new perspectives about what a user is looking for when he/she is looking for a book and keeping track of it.
Another difficulty was I was not sure if there was response bias. Because the participant had been a part of the usability 
test and knew what kind of product I was examining, maybe she knew what kind of answers I wanted for these questions. In 
addition, some of my questions may have been biased and could have tried to lead the user to answer a certain way. For example, I
gave examples of answers in my questions (e.g. "How would you judge a book? Do you look at the summary, the cover, the author...?"),
which may have led to some biased answers. Next time, I want to be really aware of the questions I am asking to try to prevent
any kind of bias. I would also want to ask a different person for my contextual interview, and possibly ask multiple people from my target
user group.
