# DHS110 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry

### Patrick Khoury | Digital Humanities 110 | Fall 2022 | Dr. Sookie Cho 


## ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?  
* This project will support users in tracking books they read, as well as finding books they want to read. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
* This activity fulfills the user’s esteem needs, more specifically esteem for oneself, 
as reading books and keeping track of them gives them a feeling of accomplishment. 
By finding books to read and keeping track of them, users will be able to feel accomplished that they have gained knowledge.

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
* The traditional solution to keep track of books people read is a “book log.” 
In a very basic book log, readers can write the title of the book and the author, 
in addition to a personal rating of the book and page numbers. 
There are products such as a book log journal (e.g. [Book Lover's Journal Reading Organizer](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Lovers-Journal-Reading-Organizer/dp/1441304827/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=book+log&qid=1587935107&sr=8-3)), 
where readers can keep track of the books they have in one place. 
* In terms of finding books, according to a research conducted by Pew Research Center in 2011, 
64% of those ages 16 and older said they get book recommendations by word of mouth, from family members, 
friends, and co-workers. Other sources include online bookstores or other websites, 
recommendations from staffers in bookstores, or librarians. (["Where People Discover and Get Their Books"](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2012/06/22/part-2-where-people-discover-and-get-their-books/)) 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
* Limitations in keeping track of books may be forgetting to write down each time a user finishes a book. 
In addition, having something like a book log journal may be tiresome, especially if people who travel often 
do not want to carry around extra items. Thus, digital technology can improve portability and make it easier 
for users to remember to keep track. 
* When finding books, people can find books from a wider social circle through technology that would 
allow them to find a diverse range of genres and topics. 


## ✅ Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: students (high school, college undergraduates), working adults, and people who are college-educated
* Preferences: users read as a hobby, or want to read for personal development, 
and thus would want to keep track of books they read and get book recommendations
* Expertise: users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project

#### Where would the users do that activity?
* Users can keep track of books anywhere; in the traditional method, as long as they have a piece of 
paper and pen, they can write down what book they read. 
In a digital method, users can log what they read anywhere at anytime, as long as they have their device.
* When finding books to read, users may do that activity in many different places—a library or a bookstore, 
or even in daily conversations with their family, friends, or co-workers, or online in an online book recommendation.  

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
* The goal of the users would be to log a book they read. To do that, they would either physically write down 
information about that book, or type it in a device to record information. To find a book to read, users may search online, 
go to a library or bookstore to browse books on their own or ask the staff, or ask their friends or family 
about book recommendations.


## ✅ Step 3: Pick Research Methods

#### Methods
* I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory observation and interview. 
  * For participatory observation, I observed 2 activities: logging a book by hand and finding a book to read in
  the Amazon Kindle store.
    * Logging a book by hand: I asked the user what a book log entry would look like, if she were to record the books she read.
    * Finding a book in the Kindle store: I asked the user how she would find a book she wants to read from the website, and 
    what she values when looking for a book to read.
* Both were conducted in the user’s own home, by their desk where they feel most comfortable. 
This would also be a place where they usually read books at home.
* I used an iPhone to voice record the interview and a laptop camera to record the user task.
* Because I could not find another in-person participant for these activity, unfortunately I had to ask the participant
from my usability test to complete these activities.

## ✅ Step 5: Conducting the Research

* Please find the transcription of the whole interview and participatory observation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntXiUR08Zort2SHEj1qfp0-OA8j3um7zz1YcoXGM_vE/edit?usp=sharing)
* Below are the recordings and videos of the interview and participatory observation.

  * [Participatory Observation: Book Log Entry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6Z54MJ6QVlY1PFlMVPBQbS5MiHW0VDS/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Participatory Observation: Kindle Store](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1deuHFWOM8IM9smYEeMUHy1REGij0QI8q/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Contextual Intervew: Other Questions & Closing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meUJAbnnbLskso-EQBxfQaAuH9I88YAC/view?usp=sharing)

* Some interesting insights from the interview:
  * *Book logging as a creative outlet*
  
    > "Handwriting it out, I feel like, would be a creative outlet, 
    like you can just lay it out however you’d like, use whatever pens you like, you know... I’d say it’s definitely 
    therapeutic, i’d want to change the style of it, maybe change the font if I don’t like it, just yeah. 
    I want it to be tailored to my kind of aesthetic or how I like it."
    
    To this user, book logging would not just be an information dump, but a place to de-stress and journal creatively about
    the book she read. It seems like she values the aesthetics and being able to tailor an entry to her own style.
    
  * *Not wanting to waste time when finding a book*
  
    > "I guess I don’t want to waste my time, so I really want to pick and choose something that I know that I would like."
    
    The user does not want to waste her time finding a book or reading a book she does not like, and thus would want a recommendation
    that is reliable.
   
  * *Sharing as a motivation for keeping track of books*
  
    > "[I'd want to include] rating, so I could recommend it to others."
    
    > *In response to "What would your motivation to record or keep track of the books be?":* 
    "So, maybe I could recommend it to other people as well, and share it with other people."
    
    Part of the motivation to keep track of books the user has read seems like being able to share books with other people,
    not just for personal records. Recording books is not just for the user's development or satisfaction, but also for 
    social connection.


## ✅ Step 6: Reflection

* The contextual inquiry process felt a lot more fluid and natural than usability testing, most likely because this was more
about *what, why,* and *how* a user does an activity and less about a particular product. Asking and observing the user gave
me a lot of interesting insight. For example, I did not expect the user to want to log a book as a creative outlet. It was also
interesting to find out that part of the motivation for recording books was to recommend them to other people. Unfortunately, I
had to use the same participant as my usability test (due to stay-at-home orders because of COVID-19), but I was still able
to find a lot of new perspectives about what a user is looking for when he/she is looking for a book and keeping track of it.
Another difficulty was I was not sure if there was response bias. Because the participant had been a part of the usability 
test and knew what kind of product I was examining, maybe she knew what kind of answers I wanted for these questions. In 
addition, some of my questions may have been biased and could have tried to lead the user to answer a certain way. For example, I
gave examples of answers in my questions (e.g. "How would you judge a book? Do you look at the summary, the cover, the author...?"),
which may have led to some biased answers. Next time, I want to be really aware of the questions I am asking to try to prevent
any kind of bias. I would also want to ask a different person for my contextual interview, and possibly ask multiple people from my target
user group.
